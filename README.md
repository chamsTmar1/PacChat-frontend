# Front-end of Chat App "PacChat"

The project "PacChat" is a Chat App with Pac-man as a main theme. 
In addition to standard chat apps features (sending messages, emojis,... between two users, login, signup, see connected users, access the messages history...), it has an integrated Pac-man game so that you can play when there is no one to talk with !

This repository contains the Front-end part of the app in React + Vite.

(For the Back-end part in .Net Core 6 and MS SQL Server, go to the repository "PacChat-backend").
